Project summary This study follows Dr Perez-Lopez’s research line in diffusion MRI and stems from the need of a better imaging protocol to evaluate metastatic bone disease in clinical practice. Unlike the current standard-of-care techniques, MRI is non-invasive and offers anatomical and functional imaging that makes it a superior choice for both visceral and bone disease follow-up.</description></item><item><title>Raquel Perez-Lopez</title><link>/team/raquel/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 12:33:46 +1000</pubDate><guid>/team/raquel/</guid><description>Raquel Perez-Lopez is the team leader of the Radiomics Group at VHIO, and consultant Radiologist at Vall d&amp;rsquo;Hebron Hospital, within the Vall d&amp;rsquo;Hebron Barcelona Hospital Campus.

Project summary In this project, we propose to develop a novel multi-omics signature by incorporating the radiomics data from clinical images (multiparametric and functional MRI) allowing to characterize the intra-tumor heterogeneity in whole tumor volume and to monitor changes at different timepoints during the treatment. Our unique imaging protocol was implemented in a prospective clinical trial and allows to noninvasively quantify histological tumor characteristics such as cellularity, vasculature and hypoxia to better characterize which patients are more prompt to respond to ICIs.</description></item><item><title>Kinga Bernatowicz</title><link>/team/kinga/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 12:33:46 +1000</pubDate><guid>/team/kinga/</guid><description>Driven by scientific curiosity, Kinga has gained a broad range of expertise in engineering, medical physics and environmental science.
