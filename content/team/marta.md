Marta is a biomedical engineer who joined the Radiomics group in 2018. She's focused on the implementation of artificial intelligence for developing CT-based radiomics biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. She also has research interest in radiomics variability and biological translation.

### Scientific trajectory

Marta is a PhD student with expertise in artificial intelligence algorithms for medical imaging applications, especially on CT-based radiomics for predicting response to treatment.
Marta graduated in Biomedical Engineering (2017) from the [University of Barcelona (UB)](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/medicina-ciencies-salut/grau/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/4917593) and received her M.Sc. in Biomedical engineering (2018) from the [Polytechnic University of Barcelona (UPC)](https://www.ub.edu/portal/web/fisica-es/masteres-universitarios/-/ensenyament/detallEnsenyament/10243501). She specialized in medical image quantification during her final master thesis at Radiomics group from Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), developing Radiomics-based algorithms for response prediction in cancer patients.

Marta is currently working as a predoctoral researcher at Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) since 2018. During her time at VHIO, she has been working on developing machine learning algorithms using CT-based radiomics data for predicting response to immunotherapy. The results of these studies have been published (M. Ligero et. al, _Radiology 2021_) and presented in oral presentations at the European Congress of Radiology (M. Ligero, _ECR 2020 Vienna_, Austria) and ESMO Congress (M. Ligero, _ESMO Congress 2019_ Barcelona, Spain)

Moreover, she has conducted CT-based radiomics reproducibility studies (M. Ligero et. al, _European Radiology 2020_) aiming to correct radiomics variability due to image acquisition and reconstruction techniques from different manufacturers.
Now, she is working on improving CT-based radiomics signatures by implementing deep learning architectures and addressing differential response. Furthermore, she has strong research interest on AI explainability and biological validation.
