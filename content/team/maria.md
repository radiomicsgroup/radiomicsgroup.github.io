### Scientific trajectory
Maria obtained a BSc in Biomedical Engineering from Universitat de Barcelona (2022). As part of her Bachelor's Thesis, she entered the Radiomics Group, where she help develop a PET-CT-based radiomics signature to predict response in patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma treated with CART T-cells. Then she pursued a MSc in Biomedical Data Science from Universitat Rovira i Virgili (2024). In this case her Master's Thesis was focused on developing an automatic segmentation tool for liver tumors. Now, as a predoctoral researcher, she is going to continue with that line of research with the goal of improving the efficacy in volumetric disease assessment with the help of Deep Learning-based tools.
