Carlos is a biomedical engineer who joined the Radiomics group in 2022. His main focus is on MRI image processing and analysis to identify new imaging biomarkers of tumoral senescence.                                                                                                                  
                                                     <br/>


Carlos obtained a BS. in Biomedical Engineering from Universidad de Sevilla (2021). As part of his bachelor's thesis, he contributed to the development of a clinical prototype for pre-treatment verification of SBRT 4D in tumors subjected to respiratory movement, at Dr. Antonio Leal Plaza's lab. He received his M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from International University of La Rioja (2023) where he specialized in medical imaging prediction to move advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging one step closer to the clinical workflows.

Moreover, Carlos is interested in new Artificial Intelligence techniques and their application in oncology research. As a predoctoral researcher at VHIO, he works on applying Machine Learning methods to process and analyse MRI images in order to identify new imaging biomarkers of tumoral senescence.
