Carlos is a biomedical engineer who joi ned the Radiomics group in 2022. His main focus is on processing and analysis of MRI images to identify new imaging biomarkers of tumoral senescence.

Carlos obtained a BS. in Biomedical Engineering from Universidad de Sevilla (2021). As part of his final degree project, he worked at the Medical Physiology and Biophysics department at Universidad de Sevilla, concretely with the Medical Physics group under the supervision of Dr. Antonio Leal Plaza, where he contributed to the development of a clinical prototype for pre-treatment verification of SBRT 4D in tumors subjected to respiratory movement.
Moreover, Carlos is interested in new Artificial Intelligence techniques and their application in oncology research. As an associated researcher at VHIO, he works on applying Machine Learning methods to process and analyse MRI images in order to identify new imaging biomarkers of tumoral senescence.
