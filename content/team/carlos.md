Carlos is a biomedical engineer who joined the Radiomics group in 2022. His research is focused on advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) processing and multi modal analysis to identify new imaging biomarkers in oncology.

### Scientific trajectory
Carlos obtained a BS. in Biomedical Engineering from Universidad de Sevilla (2021). As part of his bachelor's thesis, he contributed to the development of a clinical prototype for pre-treatment verification of SBRT 4D in tumors subjected to respiratory movement, at Dr. Antonio Leal Plaza's lab. He received his M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from International University of La Rioja (2023) where he specialized in synthetic medical images prediction to move advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging one step closer to the clinical workflows. During his masters, he worked at the Cellular Plasticity and Disease group at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB), led by Dr. Manuel Serrano. There, he digged into the mechanisms of cellular senescence and its non-invasive identification with MRI.

Moreover, Carlos is interested in multi-omics integration to study novel imaging biomarkers in oncology. As a predoctoral researcher at VHIO, he works on the developement of new MRI techniques and AI methods for digital pathology to improve tumor characterization and discover new biomarkers that could be implemented in clinical workflows.
