Ella is a Biomedical Engineering student at the Delft University of Technology. She has joined the Radiomics group in September 2022, to do her master thesis here. In 2019, she obtained a BSc in Clinical Technology, also at TU Delft.
The focus of her thesis is on estimating histological properties of tumours, based on diffusion MRI data. Specifically, she will develop an AI-based method to directly predict quantitative measures, such as cell size and intracellular fractions, from the raw MRI data.
