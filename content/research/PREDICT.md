PREdICT is a prospective imaging trial at the Vall dâ€™Hebron University Hospital and the University Clinic at Navarra.
## Project summary 

In this imaging study, initiated by Dr Perez-Lopez, we perform a prospective non-randomized multi-center study in patients treated with immunotherapy to clinically validate the CT-radiomics signature developed earlier by our group. Moreover, by acquiring multiparametric and functional MR and gathering biologically-relevant data from biopsies and blood samples, we can further develop a novel *non-invasive imaging strategy* for assessing solid tumors biology, immune cell activation and dynamics of response to immunotherapy based on radiomics signatures.

## Funding
AstraZeneca and CRIS foundation. Duration: from October 2020.
