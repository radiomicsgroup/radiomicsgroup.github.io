IseeMORE research project is focused on unravelling tumor heterogeneity and integrating multi-omics data.
## Project summary 
In this project, we propose to develop a novel *multi-omics signature* by incorporating the radiomics data from clinical images (multiparametric and functional MRI) allowing to characterize the *intra-tumor heterogeneity* in whole tumor volume and to monitor changes at different timepoints during the treatment. Our unique imaging protocol was implemented in a prospective clinical trial and allows to noninvasively quantify histological tumor characteristics such as cellularity, vasculature and hypoxia to better characterize which patients are more prompt to respond to ICIs. Proposed multi-modal imaging signature will be combined with immunophenotype signatures from histological and molecular analysis (from tumor biopsies and blood samples). State of art machine learning will be employed to select the best features and optimize the power of the predictive model. This research project links bioinformatics, radiomics, genomics, transcriptomics and clinical research. We believe that only interdisciplinary translational research can make a real difference to cancer patient care.
