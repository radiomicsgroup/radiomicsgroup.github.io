PRECIMET is a multicentric prospective imaging trial currently ongoing at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, Fundació Puigvert, Bellvitge Univerity Hospital, Malaga University Hospital, Santiago de Compostela University Hospital and Hospital Clínic de Barcelona.

## Project summary 
This study follows Dr Perez-Lopez’s research line in diffusion MRI and stems from the need of a better imaging protocol to evaluate metastatic bone disease in clinical practice. Unlike the current standard-of-care techniques, MRI is non-invasive and offers anatomical and functional imaging that makes it a superior choice for both visceral and bone disease follow-up. This study establishes a whole-body multiparametric MRI protocol for patients with bone metastases and aims at asserting its value as a biomarker of bone response to treatment.

## Funding
Prostate Cancer Foundation and Instituto de Salud Carlos III. Duration: from September 2018.

## Personnel involved
Raquel Perez-Lopez, Francesco Grussu, Alonso Garcia-Ruiz, Josep Tabernero, Manuel Escobar, et al.
