The Radiomics Group was set up at VHIO in October 2017 with the aim of developing novel image biomarkers in oncology and since then it has incorporated more than 9 team members. We integrate radiomics and genomics in translational studies towards a deeper understanding of tumor evolution and mechanisms of resistance to anti-cancer therapies.
