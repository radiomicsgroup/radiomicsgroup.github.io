Project summary In this project, we propose to develop a novel multi-omics signature by incorporating the radiomics data from clinical images (multiparametric and functional MRI) allowing to characterize the intra-tumor heterogeneity in whole tumor volume and to monitor changes at different timepoints during the treatment. Our unique imaging protocol was implemented in a prospective clinical trial and allows to noninvasively quantify histological tumor characteristics such as cellularity, vasculature and hypoxia to better characterize which patients are more prompt to respond to ICIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
